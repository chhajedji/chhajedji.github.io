		<h3 style = "color:orange;font-family:Georgia;"><a name="comp_philosophy">List of some of the practices (good?) I follow/followed while working on a computer and find them pretty useful.</a></h3>

		<ul>
			<li> Use generalized tools as much as possible. Working on a different machine would not be painful. Tool qualifies as generalized if:
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
					<br><li> It is widely available across most platforms.</li>
					<li> It has enough user support to fulfil queries about it's functionality.</li>
					<li> Example: Less, Vim, Meld, Bash etc..</li>
				</ul></li><br>
				<li> Keep shell as less bloated as possible. Even if you use lot of aliases, remember exact commands to implement them. Just another supporting point for previous point!</li><br>
				<li> Have a separate file for aliases, functions etc. Avoid bloating *rc files.</li><br>
				<li> If you don't already, start using this shell function
					<br>
					<code>
						cds() {cd "$@" 2>/dev/null && ls || vim + "$@";}
					</code>
					<br>
					It's so useful, It should have already been a default Linux command.  When do you not <samp>ls</samp> when you <samp>cd</samp> ?! And how frequently you <samp>cd</samp> into a file! This function solves it all!</li><br>
				<li>When working with *nix, master at least one of <samp>awk</samp>, <samp>sed</samp>, <samp>python</samp>, <samp>shell</samp>. Scripting is just a lifeline!</li><br>
				<li> Avoid using aliases/functions when giving a demo. Aliases just make things harder for others. Try turning on screen keys during same.</li><br>
				<li> Linux is sooo flexible, customizations are beyond imagination. All it takes is some time.</li><br>
				<li>Get famalier with less popular siblings of Google like
					<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
						<li><a href="https://photos.google.com" target="_blank">Photos</a>
							<li><a href="https://keep.google.com" target="_blank">Keep</a>
								<li><a href="https://hangouts.google.com" target="_blank">Hangouts</a>
					</ul>
					Using these tools help in syncing all devices and data together. Unlike WhatsApp Web, in Google Hangouts you don't need your phone to be connected to internet to access chats from computer. Similarly for Google Keep, you can use from computer or phone without any hassle.</li><br>
				<li>Love to use URL shortners like <a href="https://tiny.cc" target="_blank">tiny.cc</a>.</li><br>
				<li>Have a look at <a href="https://remove.bg" target="_blank">remove.bg</a>.</li><br>
				<li> Leisure reads (certified by Chinmay :)
					<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
